    

ALTERNATIVELY, if you only need data for one station:

  - Find the station's name in "ghcnd-stations.txt" and note its station
    identification code (e.g., PHOENIX AP (Airport) is "USW00023183"); and
  - Download the data file (i.e., ".dly" file) that corresponds to this code
    (e.g., "USW00023183.dly" has the data for PHOENIX AP).  
    Note that the ".dly" file is located in the "all" subdirectory.
	
"https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/all/" + station_id + ".dly"


when the user has selected the radius, station amount and has chosen a station, in the next tab: Stationsdaten, the selected stations will be shown, in addition to the years with available data for min and max temperature data.
based on the start and end year of available data a slider will be shown for the user to select a timeframe.
the relevant stations will be downloaded and the relevant information extracted
the selected data will be shown in visual graphs
